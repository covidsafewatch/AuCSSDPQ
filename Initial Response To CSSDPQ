This is because it would provide greater visibility and transparency around the prevalence and impact of these types of cyberattacks, which could help to raise awareness and encourage greater vigilance among the general public and businesses.

	Mandatory reporting requirements could also provide a more accurate picture of the scope and scale of ransomware and extortion attacks in Australia, which would be valuable for law enforcement agencies and other stakeholders seeking to combat cybercrime.

	However, it is important to note that any expansion of the notification regime would need to be carefully balanced against the potential burden on businesses and organisations. Reporting requirements could be particularly onerous for small and medium-sized businesses with limited resources, and may result in a flood of reports that are difficult to triage and prioritise.

	Therefore, any expansion of the notification regime should be accompanied by clear guidance and support for businesses, as well as a system for effective triage and response to reported incidents. Additionally, it may be useful to provide incentives for businesses to report incidents, such as protection from liability or reduced regulatory burden for companies that report incidents in a timely and transparent manner.


Q. What best practice models are available for automated threat-blocking at scale?

	There are several best practice models available for automated threat-blocking at scale. Here are some examples:

		Machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI): Machine learning and AI can be used to analyse large datasets of threat intelligence and automatically identify patterns and anomalies that may indicate a cyber threat. This can help to automate threat-blocking at scale and reduce the workload on human analysts. 

		Network segmentation: By dividing a network into smaller segments and applying different security policies to each segment, organisations can better protect against threats and limit the potential impact of a breach. This can be achieved through the use of tools like firewalls and intrusion detection systems. 

		Zero trust security: The zero trust security model assumes that all users, devices, and applications are potential threats and requires constant verification of identity and access privileges. This approach can help to prevent unauthorised access and reduce the risk of data breaches. 

		DevSecOps: DevSecOps is a security-focused approach to software development that emphasises collaboration and automation between developers, security teams, and operations teams. This approach can help to integrate security into the software development lifecycle and reduce the risk of vulnerabilities and exploits. 

		Threat intelligence sharing: By sharing threat intelligence with other organisations and security providers, businesses can better understand emerging threats and quickly respond to incidents. This can help to automate threat-blocking at scale and reduce the time to detection and response. 

	Overall, automated threat-blocking at scale requires a combination of technology, processes, and people. By adopting best practices like those listed above, organisations can better protect themselves against cyber threats and improve their overall security posture.
